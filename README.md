This is Lab â„–3 from Mobile Systems Development.
Author: Artem Sevruk, group IV-71

Challenges and issues I have been facing during completing current Lab#3:

1. Issues with autolayout constraints. It was harder unlike the similar idle Android Studio for Android Development.
2. Parsing the file. Used Codable/Decodable protocols. I spent some hours but I worked it out.
3. Slow work of macOS virtual machine causing lots of troubles and issues.
